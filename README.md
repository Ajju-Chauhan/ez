# Responsive Form with Service Cards

This project is a responsive web page that features a contact form on the left side and service cards on the right side. The layout is mobile-first, ensuring that on smaller screens, the form appears at the top and the cards appear below. On larger screens, the layout adjusts to display both sections side by side.

## Features
- Responsive Design using **CSS Flexbox** and **Media Queries**
- Mobile-first approach
- Clean and modern UI
- Form validation for email input
- Error and success messages

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **React.js** for UI components

## Responsive Design
- On **mobile devices**, the left section (form) will appear first, followed by the right section (service cards).
- On **larger screens** (768px and above), both sections will be displayed side by side using Flexbox.

## API Endpoint
- The form sends a POST request to `http://3.228.97.110:9000/api` with the email as payload.

## Example Request
```bash
POST http://3.228.97.110:9000/api
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "email": "example@email.com"
}
```
